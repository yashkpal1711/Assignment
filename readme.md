# Navbar with Dropdown and Shopping Cart

This project is a simple, responsive website that demonstrates the creation of a navigation bar with dropdown menus and an interactive shopping cart. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website features the following components:

- **Navigation Bar with Dropdown Menu:**
  - The navigation bar contains two menu items: "Home" and "Projects."
  - When hovering over the "Projects" menu item, a dropdown menu with three project links is displayed.
  - Clicking on a project link opens the respective project page.
  - The background of the page becomes blurred when the dropdown is open, except for the navigation bar.

- **Product Page:**
  - The website includes a product page featuring an image of the product, a product description, and an accordion for additional product details.
  - The "Spiced Blend" product image can be changed by selecting different radio buttons.

- **Shopping Cart:**
  - Users can open the shopping cart by clicking on the "Basket" icon.
  - The shopping cart displays the selected products, their quantities, and the total price.
  - Users can add or remove items from the cart, and the total price is updated dynamically.
  - Clicking the "Checkout" button takes the user to the checkout page.

- **Styling and Visual Effects:**
  - The website is styled using CSS, providing an attractive and user-friendly design.
  - Hover effects, transitions, and smooth scrolling are used to enhance the user experience.
